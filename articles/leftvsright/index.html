        <h2>Left vs Right - The World's Biggest Scam?</h2>
        <p class="date">Published: March 6, 2025</p><br>
      
        <p>
            Most people tend to split political topics or groups into left and right. Even though these labels fall apart under scrutiny, they can be useful for finding people with similar beliefs. Though, being able to find similar people becomes a double-edged sword.<br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
          
            People are more likely to accept or reject beliefs based on what the people around them think [1]. This applies to empathy as well. People feel less empathy towards out-groups, and the empathy they feel can decrease even more based on their perception of said group [2]. This especially doesn't help when the voterbase of the two major parties in the USA see each other as stupid, not to mention the candidates themselves:<br>
        <blockquote>
            "Crooked Joe Biden became mentally impaired, Sad. But lying Kamala Harris, honestly, I believe she was born that way..." <br><br>
            — Donald Trump [3]
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            "The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters..." <br><br>
            — Joe Biden [4]
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            The influence groups have on us is a problem when trying to think critically. No matter how smart you are, I'm sure you've dismissed an idea because of who it belongs to. This confines us into a strict box of thinking, where we are less likely to consider ideas that the people close to us don't support. And the worst part is that the boxes we're stuck in don't exist.
      </p>

      <br>
      
        <h3>The Left And Right Wing Don't Exist</h3>
        <p>
            The definitions of left and right seem to constantly change based on who is speaking. A Republican might describe a Democrat as left-wing, while a communist shuns the same person for being too right-wing. Meanwhile an anarchist might shun every one of them for being too right-wing.<br>
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "These lunatics within our government that are going to destroy our country, we have to get it stopped. They're not on the right, they're on the left." <br><br>
            — Donald Trump [5]
        </blockquote>
      
        <p>
            These patterns raise the question: What is left and right? You could try to define it topic by topic, but that all falls apart. In no world is a pro-life communist equal to a Republican. You could also try to use the political compass' definitions. But what happens if someone is a nationalist white-supremacist who also wants the workers to own the means of production? Suddenly a fascist becomes put on the left of the compass. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h3>What Do We Use Then?</h3>
      
              <p>
            We shouldn't use such broad labels at all. It encourages us to reject or accept certain beliefs just because of what other people believe [1]. We should go topic by topic. If someone brings up Ukraine, you wouldn't say you're right or left, you'd say if you support it or not. If you can't argue against something without bringing up what side it's from, can you really argue against it?<br>
