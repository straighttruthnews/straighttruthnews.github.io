        <summary>Interview With A Libertarian</summary>
        <div class="bs-content">
        <p><strong>Name:</strong> Sue</p><br>

        <p><strong>Q:</strong> How would you define libertarianism?</p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> Libertarianism is living as free and sovereign people with no big brother government control, and if there is a government we get to decide what it is as a group. When you buy something, you own it too. Good riddance to property tax and income tax.</p><br>

        <p><strong>Q:</strong> What does an ideal society look like to you?</p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> Living tax free and not being told what you can and can't do. There will be no regulations to jump through. If you want to build a barn on your property, you can go and build a barn. Doing a service for a good will also replace money. Exceptions will be made for the elderly who can no longer do services. Schools will be focused on what kids are good at instead of memorizing everything. The schooling will start at home, and you will find what you are good at and interested in. Then you can get educated for that skill.</p><br>

        <p><strong>Q:</strong> Without a government, how do you see people dealing with crime?</p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> Crimes will be dealt with by the people on an eye for an eye system.</p><br>

        <p><strong>Q:</strong> How would people deal with potential monopolies caused by no economic regulation?</p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> Goods and services replacing money will prevent this.</p>

        <p><strong>Q:</strong> How would the people defend against an invasion with no government?</p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> There would be militias, and the people will protect themselves.</p>

        <p><strong>Q:</strong> What would you say is the biggest opposition to libertarianism right now?</p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> The existence of government</p>

        <p><strong>Q:</strong> What would be the biggest opposition to libertarianism in a libertarian society?</p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> Greed</p>

        <p><strong>Q:</strong> Do you support free education or free healthcare? If so, how will these be achieved in a libertarian society?</p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> I don't support free healthcare, but it should be at an affordable rate. I support free education, but the education should be started at home, and once you learn what you are good at, you will go somewhere to improve that skill. This will stay free by paying the person teaching you in labor, like an apprenticeship or on the job training.</p>
